/*
 * CHANGELOG.
 */

10182003 - Fixed testqueueing.c to not eat whole CPU.
10162003 - Moved some stuff around in alExtension.c in hopes of clearing out
           the gcc 3.1 optimization bug.
10152003 - Hack in arbitrary upsamplers to fix buffer overflow. I'm still
           displeased with the resampling code. I want it to sound better
           without sacrificing too much speed. Panning code was backwards
           (whoops), so audio should play left-to-right correctly now.
10142003 - Removed a FIXME comment.
10132003 - Makefile should now favor internal Ogg Vorbis headers over those
           installed system-wide.
10122003 - Initial posting on icculus.org.
