 * CHANGELOG.
 */

10202003 - Added Altivec mono8 mixer. Mono16 and Mono8 mixers now never fall
           back to scalar version unless absolutely forced to, for notable
           speed boost. Average mono8 and mono16 mixing time in ut2003 is
           now up to four times less. Other minor fixes, cleanups, and
           optimizations to the mixers.
10192003 - Minor fixes to the Vorbis decoder...some .oggs were suffering from
           minor decoding defects due to some optimizations.
10182003 - Fixed testqueueing.c to not eat whole CPU. alBufferData() now uses
           linear resampling when converting to device format (thanks, Joe!).
           Some other corrections and cleanups.
10162003 - Moved some stuff around in alExtension.c in hopes of clearing out
           the gcc 3.1 optimization bug.
10152003 - Hack in arbitrary upsamplers to fix buffer overflow. I'm still
           displeased with the resampling code. I want it to sound better
           without sacrificing too much speed. Panning code was backwards
           (whoops), so audio should play left-to-right correctly now.
10142003 - Removed a FIXME comment.
10132003 - Makefile should now favor internal Ogg Vorbis headers over those
           installed system-wide.
10122003 - Initial posting on icculus.org.
