- Spatialization is backwards?!
- Resamplers need altivec versions.
- Resamplers need to suck less.
- Vorbis extension needs resampling to device format.
- Capture extension
- Pitch resampling.
- Mono output.
- AL_FORMAT_STEREO_FLOAT32_EXT extension
- AL_FORMAT_MONO_FLOAT32_EXT extension
- > 2 channel output.
- Make alExtension.c not suck.
- Device enumeration is hacky.
- Look for FIXMEs.
- Remove ov_read_callbacks abstraction and use ogg buffer directly to
  relieve memcpy pressure and reduce memory bandwidth?
- Make sure Ogg Vorbis always aligns buffers on 16 byte boundaries.
- Make altivec mixers work with unaligned input (and use scalar for unaligned
  output at start of buffers, so we can avoid ever falling into a completely
  scalar mixing path.
- Altivec mixer for mono8 is missing.
