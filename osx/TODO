- Resamplers need altivec versions.
- Resamplers need to suck less.
- Vorbis extension needs resampling to device format.
- Capture extension
- Pitch resampling.
- Mono output.
- AL_FORMAT_STEREO_FLOAT32_EXT extension
- AL_FORMAT_MONO_FLOAT32_EXT extension
- > 2 channel output.
- Make alExtension.c not suck.
- Device enumeration feels hacky.
- Look for FIXMEs.
- Remove ov_read_callbacks abstraction and use ogg buffer directly to
  relieve memcpy pressure and reduce memory bandwidth?
- Make sure Ogg Vorbis always aligns buffers on 16 byte boundaries.
- Make altivec stereo16 mixer works with unaligned input (and use scalar for
  unaligned output at start of buffers, so we can avoid ever falling into a
  completely scalar mixing path. See mono mixers for reference.
- Altivec mixer for stereo8 is missing.
- Arbitrary downsampling is probably broken.
