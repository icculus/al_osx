This is a mangled version of libogg-1.0. If you want the clean, cross-platform
version of this, please visit xiph.org.

This version is optimized for MacOSX...a LOT of the code is vectorized with
Altivec (but should still work on a pre-G4). Other pieces of code were also
redesigned to run faster in a general sense.

All the extraneous files (autoconf, etc) have been stripped out...this is all
meant to be specially built and statically linked into this Mac-specific AL.
If you were to merge the changes back into the mainline AL release, you would
need to:

  - #define MACOSX on the compiler commandline.
  - Implement _vorbis_has_vector_unit() (see libvorbis's misc.h). We check
    a global variable in OpenAL, but you should find a good place to call
    Gestalt() in libvorbis to determine if the system has an Altivec unit and
    set a static variable in libvorbis appropriately.
  - The software should still build on non-Mac systems, but you will probably
    want to fill in SSE (or whatever) support and set
    _vorbis_has_vector_unit() appropriately. By default, this should be
    #defined to zero and thus the vectorized stuff should compile out.
