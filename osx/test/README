These tests are not meant to be robust, clean, coherent, or comprehensive.

My command lines:

cd /where/i/keep/al_osx/osx
make
gcc -I../include/AL -O3 -g -I../include -o test ./test/test.c \
     ./openal.dylib -force_cpusubtype_ALL
gcc -I../include/AL -O3 -g -I../include -o testqueueing ./test/testqueueing.c \
     ./openal.dylib -force_cpusubtype_ALL

test.c relies on you manually editing the source for various options. Both
expect audio files with specific names in the current directory...read the
source.
