Building on MacOSX:

 - Have the Apple developer tools installed. (http://developer.apple.com/)
 - Run "make" in this directory. This will build openal.dylib, optimized,
   with support for our various extensions enabled.
 - There are options at the top of "makefile" if you want to disable
   various extensions, optimizations, or use IBM's compiler instead.
 - To use the compiled library, copy the .dylib into your project, and link
   against it directly or dynamically load it and use alGetProcAddress() to
   obtain the entry points. When linking against it directly, the OS will
   expect to find the .dylib in the same directory as your application's
   binary at runtime, which makes it convenient for shipping it with your
   software. Ideally, you want to structure your program so you can swap this
   .dylib out with a different implementation in the future without having to
   change/recompile the program itself.

There is no Project Builder support at this time, and this does not build a
framework. There is no "make install". Support for these things are welcome,
so long as they don't screw with my ability to type "make" and go.  :)
